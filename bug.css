The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 20px + 5%);` might not calculate as you intend.  The order of operations might lead to the percentage being applied after the pixel subtraction, resulting in a different width than expected.  Another common error involves using spaces incorrectly within the `calc()` function. Spaces must be placed correctly around operators.  For example, `width:calc(100%-20px)` is incorrect, it must be `width: calc(100% - 20px);`.
